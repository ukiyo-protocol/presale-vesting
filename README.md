# Vesting Smart Contract

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains a smart contract for implementing a vesting mechanism for tokens. Vesting is a common practice in token distribution where tokens are locked for a certain period before they can be fully accessed by users. This contract is designed to facilitate controlled token release based on predefined vesting rules.

## Features

- **Vesting Rules**: Define vesting rules such as lockup duration and release schedules.
- **Token Management**: Manage token allocations for users and track vested tokens.
- **Access Control**: Implement access control to manage who can create vesting schedules and claim vested tokens.
- **Oracle Integration**: Utilize oracles to obtain real-time price data for calculating token values.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the vesting smart contract:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed.

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract**: Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. Specify the address of the ERC-20 token contract and the necessary oracles.

3. **Define Vesting Rules**: Set up the vesting rules, including lockup duration and release schedules.

4. **Create Vesting Schedules**: Create vesting schedules for users, specifying the amount, duration, and release intervals.

5. **Claim Vested Tokens**: Users can claim their vested tokens based on the defined schedules and lockup periods.
